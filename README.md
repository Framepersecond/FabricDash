## Overview

FabricDash is a powerful web administration panel for Fabric Minecraft servers. It gives server owners and staff a clean, responsive operations surface for monitoring performance, managing players, running console commands, browsing files, maintaining mods, reviewing Guardian activity, handling backups, and applying GitHub-backed updates without needing direct terminal access for every task.

FabricDash keeps the familiar single-server workflow while making day-to-day operations smoother: secure setup, staff tools, local Fabric mod maintenance, Modrinth search, notifications, graph snapshots, Guardian investigation tools, mobile-friendly layouts, and polished browser interactions for desktop, tablet, and mobile operators.

## Current Release

- **Latest version:** `v4.0`
- **Release date:** `2026-07-06`
- **Release:** available from the [GitHub releases page](../../releases)
- **License:** BSD 3-Clause

## What's New in FabricDash 4.0

FabricDash 4.0 is the major Fabric release after 3.1. It brings the new Dash motion system, a cleaner Guardian experience, stronger file interactions, local Fabric mod maintenance, and clearer GitHub-backed update workflows to Fabric servers.

### Motion and Interface Polish

- Rebuilt the shared animation layer for smoother page transitions and content swaps.
- Added smoother card entrances, row reveals, hover lift, press feedback, status flips, and value flashes.
- Removed the bumpy feel when switching between pages.
- Preserved reduced-motion support for operators who prefer less animation.
- Tuned transitions around transform and opacity patterns for a smoother browser experience.

### Guardian

- Shortened the Guardian activity area with a fixed-height, scrollable table surface.
- Added paging for Timeline, Blocks, and Containers.
- Added sticky activity headers for easier scanning.
- Spread Guardian tools across a full-width responsive grid instead of stacking everything in one right-side column.
- Kept cases, notes, rollback, incidents, scores, replay, restore, alert rules, retention, purge, and import tools available.

### Files and Mods

- File and folder rows now open from the whole row bubble, not only from the name.
- Upload, edit, rename, download, and delete flows keep operators in context.
- Fabric mod maintenance remains local to FabricDash.
- Installed mod state, JAR upload, and Modrinth search are available from the dashboard.

### GitHub and Update Workflows

- GitHub-backed release checks remain targeted at `Framepersecond/FabricDash`.
- Update scans are rate-limit aware.
- Manual update scans can retry when needed.
- Staged updates apply through the Fabric mods workflow.

### NeoDash Bridge

- Restart from a NeoDash SSO session delegates to NeoDash's configured start path.
- Restart redirects into NeoDash startup-log visibility for Fabric servers.
- Bridge values are stored consistently with Dash and ForgeDash.

### Release Metadata

- Gradle `mod_version` updated to `4.0`.
- Fabric metadata now points to the FabricDash GitHub repository.

## Features

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Live server statistics, including TPS, memory usage, and CPU usage.

## Installation

1. Download the latest FabricDash release JAR from the [releases page](../../releases).
2. Place the JAR file in your Fabric server's `mods` folder.
3. Restart your Minecraft server.
4. Open the generated FabricDash configuration and adjust the web port if needed. The default port is `8080`.
5. Restart the server again to apply configuration changes.

## Initial Setup

1. Join your server as an operator.
2. Run `/dash register` in-game to generate a registration code.
3. Open the dashboard in your browser:

   ```text
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   Replace `8080` with your configured port if you changed it.

4. Enter the registration code and create your admin account.
5. Log in and start managing your server through FabricDash.

> For production use, run FabricDash behind HTTPS through a reverse proxy or a secure hosting panel whenever the dashboard is exposed outside your local machine.

## Commands

| Command | Description | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dash register` | Generates a web registration code that expires after 5 minutes. | `dash.register` |

## Permissions

| Permission | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dash.register` | Allows a player to generate web registration codes. | `op` |

## Configuration

FabricDash creates a server-side configuration file on first start. Use it to adjust the dashboard port, database storage, backup retention, and related server settings.

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Web server port for the admin dashboard
port: 8080

# Database settings for player data tracking
database:
  type: sqlite
  file: dash.db

# Backup settings
backups:
  directory: backups
  max-backups: 10
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | Web server port used by the dashboard. | `8080` |
| `database.type` | Database backend for player data tracking. Currently supports SQLite. | `sqlite` |
| `database.file` | SQLite database file name. | `dash.db` |
| `backups.directory` | Directory used for backup archives. | `backups` |
| `backups.max-backups` | Maximum number of backups to retain. | `10` |

## Supported Versions

| Requirement | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Minecraft | `1.21`, `1.21.1`, `1.21.2`, `1.21.3`, `1.21.4+` |
| Server software | Fabric servers |
| Java | `21` or higher |

## Security

FabricDash includes several built-in security measures for safer server administration:

- Registration codes expire after 5 minutes.
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie handling.
- Explicit logout flow and session hardening updates.
- Admin credentials are hashed before storage.
- File uploads are validated.
- File paths are sanitized to reduce traversal risks.
- Administrative actions are logged with IP tracking.
- Bridge approvals keep SSO identities gated behind admin review.

## Recommended Production Setup

When exposing the dashboard publicly, use a secure deployment setup:

- Put FabricDash behind HTTPS.
- Restrict the dashboard port with a firewall where possible.
- Use strong admin credentials.
- Only approve bridge users you trust.
- Keep FabricDash updated through the latest GitHub release.
- Regularly download or rotate important backups.
- Review Guardian activity, incidents, alert rules, and retention settings regularly.
